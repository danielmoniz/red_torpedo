<h1>What is Sourst?</h1>


<h3>Sourst is a social networking site - but without friend lists! </h3>

<p>We take advantage of the world wide web to put people in touch with 
other people. Every time you post, we look for other posts similar to yours. 
This allows us to connect you with people you can actually talk to.</p>

<p>We also use the topics you add to provide you with suggestions of users 
that you might get along with in the form of the "You might like" bar. In 
order to encourage you to seek new interests, Sourst shows you those users' 
latest posts.</p>

<p>We also find people that have very little in common with you, just to 
throw you some curve balls. You might be surprised at the gems you find 
in the "You might hate" section!</p>

<h3>Track people you've connected with.</h3>

<p>You just might find yourself talking to the same person on more than 
one occasion. Or, perhaps you know a friend or celebrity whose messages 
you always want to see. Track them and visit the Tracking page to keep 
tabs on those people.</p>

<p>We care that our users don't have to trudge through posts they don't want 
to see. The tracking page allows you to filter the posts you see by the 
person so that you can read what you want.</p>

<h3>Don't lose track of posts!</h3>

<p>Sometimes a conversation will start up on somebody else's post. To help 
    you make sure you don't lose track of it, Sourst allows you to Favourite 
    posts. We also strive to show you posts that you're active on when they 
receive new activity.</p>

<p>If the same post keeps showing up, welcome the "No Leap-frogging" feature, 
also called "NLF". This feature prevents the post from jumping up your 
feed.</p>

<h3>A tool, or a toy?</h3>

<p>We're really hoping that it's both! As a founder, I became interested in 
this project because I knew it would be a tool I would actually use. Though
I plan on using it as a tool to meet other like-minded people, other people 
will surely use it in other ways.</p>

<p>If you think Sourst could be improved in some way, let us know by using the 
feedback tool. We take all input very seriously.</p>
